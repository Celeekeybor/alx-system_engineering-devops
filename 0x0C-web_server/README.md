1. Install nginx web server
mandatory
Score: 0.0% (Checks completed: 0.0%)


Readme:

-y on apt-get command
Web servers are the piece of software generating and serving HTML pages, let’s install one!

Requirements:

Install nginx on your web-01
server
Nginx should be listening on port 80
When querying Nginx at its root / with a GET request (requesting a page) using curl, it must return a page that contains the string Hello World!
As an answer file, write a Bash script that configures a new Ubuntu machine to respect above requirements (this script will be run on the server itself)
You can’t use systemctl for restarting nginx
Server terminal:

root@sy-web-01$ ./1-install_nginx_web_server > /dev/null 2>&1
root@sy-web-01$
root@sy-web-01$ curl localhost
Hello World!
root@sy-web-01$
Local terminal:

sylvain@ubuntu$ curl 34.198.248.145/
Hello World!
sylvain@ubuntu$ curl -sI 34.198.248.145/
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: nginx/1.4.6 (Ubuntu)
Date: Tue, 21 Feb 2017 23:43:22 GMT
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 30
Last-Modified: Tue, 21 Feb 2017 07:21:32 GMT
Connection: keep-alive
ETag: "58abea7c-1e"
Accept-Ranges: bytes

sylvain@ubuntu$
In this example 34.198.248.145 is the IP of my web-01 server. If you want to query the Nginx that is locally installed on your server, you can use curl 127.0.0.1.

If things are not going as expected, make sure to check out Nginx logs, they can be found in /var/log/.

Maarten’s PRO-tip: When you use sudo su on your web-01 you can become root like this to test your file:

sylvain@ubuntu$ sudo su
root@ubuntu#

2. Setup a domain name
mandatory
Score: 0.0% (Checks completed: 0.0%)
.TECH Domains is one of the top domain providers. They are known for the stability and quality of their DNS hosting solution. We partnered with .TECH Domains so that you can learn about DNS.

.TECH Domains worked with domain name registrars to give you access to a free domain name for a year. Please get the promo code in your tools space. Feel free to drop a thank you tweet for .TECH Domains.

Provide the domain name in your answer file.

Requirement:

provide the domain name only (example: foobar.tech), no subdomain (example: www.foobar.tech)
configure your DNS records with an A entry so that your root domain points to your web-01 IP address Warning: the propagation of your records can take time (~1-2 hours)
go to your profile and enter your domain in the Project website url field
Example:

sylvain@ubuntu$ cat 2-setup_a_domain_name
myschool.tech
sylvain@ubuntu$
sylvain@ubuntu$ dig myschool.tech

; <<>> DiG 9.10.6 <<>> myschool.tech

When your domain name is setup, please verify the Registrar here: https://whois.whoisxmlapi.com/ and you must see in the JSON response: "registrarName": "Dotserve Inc"

3. Redirection
mandatory
Score: 0.0% (Checks completed: 0.0%)
Readme:

Replace a line with multiple lines with sed
Configure your Nginx server so that /redirect_me is redirecting to another page.

Requirements:

The redirection must be a “301 Moved Permanently”
You answer file should be a Bash script containing commands to automatically configure a Ubuntu machine to respect above requirements
Using what you did with 1-install_nginx_web_server, write 3-redirection so that it configures a brand new Ubuntu machine to the requirements asked in this task
Example:

sylvain@ubuntu$ curl -sI 34.198.248.145/redirect_me/
HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
Server: nginx/1.4.6 (Ubuntu)
Date: Tue, 21 Feb 2017 21:36:04 GMT

4. Not found page 404
mandatory
Score: 0.0% (Checks completed: 0.0%)
Configure your Nginx server to have a custom 404 page that contains the string Ceci n'est pas une page.

Requirements:

The page must return an HTTP 404 error code
The page must contain the string Ceci n'est pas une page
Using what you did with 3-redirection, write 4-not_found_page_404 so that it configures a brand new Ubuntu machine to the requirements asked in this task
Example:

sylvain@ubuntu$ curl -sI 34.198.248.145/xyz
HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
Server: nginx/1.4.6 (Ubuntu)

5. Install Nginx web server (w/ Puppet)
#advanced
Score: 0.0% (Checks completed: 0.0%)
Time to practice configuring your server with Puppet! Just as you did before, we’d like you to install and configure an Nginx server using Puppet instead of Bash. To save time and effort, you should also include resources in your manifest to perform a 301 redirect when querying /redirect_me.

Requirements:

Nginx should be listening on port 80
When querying Nginx at its root / with a GET request (requesting a page) using curl, it must return a page that contains the string Hello World!
The redirection must be a “301 Moved Permanently”
Your answer file should be a Puppet manifest containing commands to automatically configure an Ubuntu machine to respect above requirements

GitHub repository: alx-system_engineering-devops
Directory: 0x0C-web_server
