0x0F-load_balancer



0. Double the number of webservers
mandatory
In this first task you need to configure web-02 to be identical to web-01. Fortunately, you built a Bash script during your web server project, and they’ll now come in handy to easily configure web-02. Remember, always try to automate your work!

Since we’re placing our web servers behind a load balancer for this project, we want to add a custom Nginx response header. The goal here is to be able to track which web server is answering our HTTP requests, to understand and track the way a load balancer works. More in the coming tasks.

Requirements:

Configure Nginx so that its HTTP response contains a custom header (on web-01 and web-02)
The name of the custom HTTP header must be X-Served-By
The value of the custom HTTP header must be the hostname of the server Nginx is running on
Write 0-custom_http_response_header so that it configures a brand new Ubuntu machine to the requirements asked in this task
Ignore SC2154 for shellcheck
Example:

sylvain@ubuntu$ curl -sI 34.198.248.145 | grep X-Served-By
X-Served-By: 03-web-01
sylvain@ubuntu$ curl -sI 54.89.38.100 | grep X-Served-By
X-Served-By: 03-web-02
sylvain@ubuntu$
If your server’s hostnames are not properly configured ([STUDENT_ID]-web-01 and [STUDENT_ID]-web-02.), follow this tutorial.

1. Install your load balancer
mandatory
Install and configure HAproxy on your lb-01 server.

Requirements:

Configure HAproxy so that it send traffic to web-01 and web-02
Distribute requests using a roundrobin algorithm
Make sure that HAproxy can be managed via an init script
Make sure that your servers are configured with the right hostnames: [STUDENT_ID]-web-01 and [STUDENT_ID]-web-02. If not, follow this tutorial.
For your answer file, write a Bash script that configures a new Ubuntu machine to respect above requirements
Example:

sylvain@ubuntu$ curl -Is 54.210.47.110
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: nginx/1.4.6 (Ubuntu)

2. Add a custom HTTP header with Puppet
#advanced
Just as in task #0, we’d like you to automate the task of creating a custom HTTP header response, but with Puppet.

The name of the custom HTTP header must be X-Served-By
The value of the custom HTTP header must be the hostname of the server Nginx is running on
Write 2-puppet_custom_http_response_header.pp so that it configures a brand new Ubuntu machine to the requirements asked in this task
Repo:

GitHub repository: alx-system_engineering-devops
Directory: 0x0F-load_balancer
File: 2-puppet_custom_http_response_header.pp
