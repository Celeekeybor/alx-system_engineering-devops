Use a private key
mandatory
Score: 0.0% (Checks completed: 0.0%)
Write a Bash script that uses ssh to connect to your server using the private key ~/.ssh/school with the user ubuntu.

Requirements:

Only use ssh single-character flags
You cannot use -l
You do not need to handle the case of a private key protected by a passphrase
sylvain@ubuntu$ ./0-use_a_private_key
ubuntu@server01:~$ exit
Connection to 8.8.8.8 closed.

1. Create an SSH key pair
mandatory
Score: 0.0% (Checks completed: 0.0%)
Write a Bash script that creates an RSA key pair.

Requirements:

Name of the created private key must be school
Number of bits in the created key to be created 4096
The created key must be protected by the passphrase betty
Example:

sylvain@ubuntu$ ls
1-create_ssh_key_pair
sylvain@ubuntu$ ./1-create_ssh_key_pair
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Your identification has been saved in school.
Your public key has been saved in school.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
5d:a8:c1:f5:98:b6:e5:c0:9b:ee:02:c4:d4:01:f3:ba vagrant@ubuntu
The key's randomart image is:

2. Client configuration file
mandatory
Score: 0.0% (Checks completed: 0.0%)
Your machine has an SSH configuration file for the local SSH client, letâ€™s configure it to our needs so that you can connect to a server without typing a password. Share your SSH client configuration in your answer file.

Requirements:

Your SSH client configuration must be configured to use the private key ~/.ssh/school
Your SSH client configuration must be configured to refuse to authenticate using a password
Example:

sylvain@ubuntu$ ssh -v ubuntu@98.98.98.98

In the example above, we can see that ssh tries to authenticate using school and does not try to authenticate using a password. You can replace 98.98.98.98 by the IP of your server for testing purposes.

Now that you have successfully connected to your server, we would also like to join the party.

Add the SSH public key below to your server so that we can connect using the ubuntu user.
