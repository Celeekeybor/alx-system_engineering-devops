0. Change your home IP
mandatory
Write a Bash script that configures an Ubuntu server with the below requirements.

Requirements:

localhost resolves to 127.0.0.2
facebook.com resolves to 8.8.8.8.
The checker is running on Docker, so make sure to read this
Example:

sylvain@ubuntu$ ping localhost
PING localhost (127.0.0.1) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from localhost (127.0.0.1): icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.012 ms
^C
--- localhost ping statistics ---
1 packets transmitted, 1 received, 0% packet loss, time 0ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.012/0.012/0.012/0.000 ms
sylvain@ubuntu$
sylvain@ubuntu$ ping facebook.com
PING facebook.com (157.240.11.35) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from edge-star-mini-shv-02-lax3.facebook.com (157.240.11.35): icmp_seq=1 ttl=63 time=15.4 ms
^C
--- facebook.com ping statistics ---
1 packets transmitted, 1 received, 0% packet loss, time 0ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 15.432/15.432/15.432/0.000 ms
sylvain@ubuntu$
sylvain@ubuntu$ sudo ./0-change_your_home_IP
sylvain@ubuntu$
sylvain@ubuntu$ ping localhost
PING localhost (127.0.0.2) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from localhost (127.0.0.2): icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.012 ms
64 bytes from localhost (127.0.0.2): icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=0.036 ms
^C
--- localhost ping statistics ---
2 packets transmitted, 2 received, 0% packet loss, time 1000ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.012/0.024/0.036/0.012 ms
sylvain@ubuntu$
sylvain@ubuntu$ ping facebook.com
PING facebook.com (8.8.8.8) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from facebook.com (8.8.8.8): icmp_seq=1 ttl=63 time=8.06 ms
^C
--- facebook.com ping statistics ---
1 packets transmitted, 1 received, 0% packet loss, time 0ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 8.065/8.065/8.065/0.000 ms
In this example we can see that:

before running the script, localhost resolves to 127.0.0.1 and facebook.com resolves to 157.240.11.35
after running the script, localhost resolves to 127.0.0.2 and facebook.com resolves to 8.8.8.8
If you’re running this script on a machine that you’ll continue to use, be sure to revert localhost to 127.0.0.1. Otherwise, a lot of things will stop working!

1. Show attached IPs
mandatory
Write a Bash script that displays all active IPv4 IPs on the machine it’s executed on.

Example:

sylvain@ubuntu$ ./1-show_attached_IPs | cat -e
10.0.2.15$
127.0.0.1$
sylvain@ubuntu$
Obviously, the IPs displayed may be different depending on which machine you are running the script on.

Note that we can see our localhost IP :)
